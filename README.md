### hex_rgb_constant1
(TD v099) Converts hex values to normalized rgb (0-1) as TD currently only accepts those or hsv for color values. Set the value in the component's OPTIONS page. Outputs a Constant TOP as well as a CHOP with red, green and blue channels (e.g. connect a Select CHOP to it's Out to read the three channels).
